# Team-34

Our team consists of four determined women who have decided to enter the IT world:

GIRTA from Saku Parish, Estonia: I have set a goal to make the IT world a bit clearer for myself and that's why I'm here. by the end of the course, I definitely want to complete my own project, whether I'll succeed... time will tell. I've had several professions - bioanalyst, customer management coordinator, and now a teacher as well. I hope to find great peers and study partners in the course to crack codes together
DINA- originally from Kuldiga, Latvia, now living in Portugal, but moving back to Latvia in 2 weeks, in the process of moving jobs and countries, new, exciting chapter ahead.
Katrin - I am currently a bioanalyst from Tartu and a mother of three. I am passionate about AI and eager to deepen my understanding of it. My goal is to find a way to integrate IT with medicine. In my lab, we are developing an e-lab solution, allowing me to actively participate in this intersection. However, I must admit, it has been quite challenging for me.
